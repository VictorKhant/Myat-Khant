# Myat-Khant
- Hey there! My name is Myat Khant, but I go by Victor since it is easier to pronounce. I am a first-generation college student from Myanmar currently studying at Pasadena City College. My goal is to transfer to a 4-years university, and hoping to pursue a career in technology. In my free time, I like playing video games, learning new coding languages from YouTube videos, and going to the gym.

- I am currently serving as a board member for the She Codes Club at Pasadena City College, a community for aspiring Computer Science students to support each other and explore the world of coding together while bridging the gender gaps in the STEM and Computer Science industries. Recently, I got an opportunity to spearhead as a local lead for the NASA Space Apps Challenge, where our team hosted a local hackathon event and recruited over 150 participants.

- As I continue on this journey, I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead and remain steadfast in my commitment to making a positive impact in the tech industry and beyond.
